# Linear-Algebra Implementation

The execution of neural networks involves linear algebra data structures multiplied and added together. Scaled up to multiple dimensions, deep learning methods work with vectors, matrices, and even tensors of inputs and coefficients, where a tensor is a matrix with more than two dimensions.

Linear algebra is central to the description of deep learning methods via matrix notation to the implementation of deep learning methods such as Google’s TensorFlow Python library that has the word “tensor” in its name.

Linear Algebra is used for many applications. Some of these include:

*The use of linear algebra structures when working with data such as tabular datasets and images.

*Linear algebra concepts when working with data preparation such as one hot encoding and dimensionality reduction.

*The ingrained use of linear algebra notation and methods in sub-fields such as deep learning, natural language processing, and recommender systems.
